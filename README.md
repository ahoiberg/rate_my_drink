Rate My Drink is an application that allows users to rate a drink (or honestly anything) on a scale of 1-5 and submit any other relevant information (comments, pictures, etc)

Rate My Drink is written in TypeScript and can be run by simply opening the HTML file ```index.html```

Development plan is as follows:

1. Create individual entries (with name, rating, and comment).
2. Create UI such that entries can be considered a CRUD application

3. Enable average ratings that aggregate individual ratings (e.g. rated 4.5/5 overall)

Stretch goals:
1. require users to be authenticated?  
    -maybe add some social network capability
2. deploy to some external server
